Web application for structuring day routine

## STRUCTURE
Web consists out of blocks of days inside of a week, which then are separated into blocks of tasks. E.G look:

|YYYY-MM-DD  CLR     |
|--------------------|
|[Shower]-5min   -8AM|
|[Facial Hygiene]-5min   -8:05AM|
|[Exercises]-5min   -8:10AM|
|[Work]-1h15   -8:15AM|

## GOAL
Goal is to
- Discipline myself and finish the project in ==one week==.
- ==No code copying== from Chat-GPT or any other AI. 
> AI may be used to generate ideas or develop solutions, but nothing more.
- Do at least ==one commit per day==.
- Check the checkboxes bellow with each day passed:
---
- [ ] Day 1 **START**
- [ ] Day 2
- [ ] Day 3
- [ ] Day 4
- [ ] Day 5
- [ ] Day 6
